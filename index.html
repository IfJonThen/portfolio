  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I enjoy outdoor activities such as rock climing and swimming. I swam and played WaterPolo in High School</li>

  <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Class Examiner
<ul>
    <li>This is a personal project that I started this quarter. Some of my friends are currently serving on the Scholarship committee with also one residing at its head in a couple of the organizations that I am currently apart of. I figured that this tool might serve useful to them in the future to help other students to get more excited about school and to aide in their learning progress. <a href="class_examiner.html">Check it out!</a></li>
</ul>
      </li>
      <li>JCT
<ul>
    <li>JCT is a comparison tool that I made for some family friends to help them in comparing computer parts. It was a SPA that I originally created with the JQuery library and bootstrap but later I tried to remake it with AngularJS</li>
</ul>
      </li>
      <li>ClutchIdea
<ul>
    <li>This was my capstone project for Informatics 191A/B. With some of my friends at UCI, we created a mac os client which allowed for users of the Gaming platform Steam to turn on a virtual machine in the cloud at a click of a button and have it configured ready to go to start streaming your Steam library of games </li>
</ul>
      </li>
      <li>ReadyKGO
<ul>
    <li>ReadyKGO is a website that I made with a friend back in highschool. We created it as a learning alternative to using a premade online store such as with Square Space or E-commerce. It was my initial jump into web development and thus I used dreamweaver to pick up the concepts. </li>
</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
